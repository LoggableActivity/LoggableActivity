Loggable Activity Generator Help
--------------------------------

Description:
  This generator creates files and configurations for integrating the Loggable Activity gem into your Rails application.

Usage:
  rails generate loggable_activity [options]

Options:
  -h, [--help], [--no-help]           # Display usage instructions (this message)
  -m, [--uuid]                        # Use uuids for primary_keys

Examples:
  rails generate loggable_activity  --uuid  # Generate loggable activity migration files with uuids for primary_keys 

Note:
  - This generator assumes that you have already installed the Loggable Activity gem.
  - Ensure that your database schema supports UUIDs if using them as primary keys.

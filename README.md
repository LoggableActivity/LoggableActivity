### Applications
Most organizations needs to keep a log of how users interact with data stored in the DB
- Finance
- Healthcare
- Sales

*Super simplified example from the healthcare.*
- Each patient has a journal, that is updated on a regular basis.
- Supervisor needs to follow the journal.
- Security personnel needs to know how the journal is handled, who did what when.
- Patients has the right to their journal.

Beside the journal in the db, an activity log is kept so it is possible to track how the journal is used.<br/>
At some point in time the patients data from the DB and the activity log has to be removed according to GDPR.<br/>

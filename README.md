### What it is not
- An error logging system

- A backup system

### Applications
Most organizations needs to keep a log of how users interact with data stored in the DB
- Finance
- Healthcare
- Sales and Support

*Super simplified example from the healthcare.*
- Each patient has a journal, that is updated on a regular basis.
- Supervisor needs to follow the journal, how was it updated, who read it, did it get deleted.
- Security personnel needs to know how the journal is handled, who did what when.
- Patients has the right to know how their journal is handled and that their data will be removed when required.

Beside the journal in the db, an activity log is kept so it is possible to track how the journal is used.<br/>
At some point in time the patients data from the DB and the activity log has to be removed according to GDPR.<br/>

### Test
We embrace the philosophy of black-box testing, where we focus on the input and output of the public interface without worrying about internal implementation details.<br/>
This approach aligns with the principle of testing behavior rather than implementation.

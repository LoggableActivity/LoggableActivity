## Loggable Activity - Work in progress ðŸŒŸ
Logging of who did what when while complying to the Genera Data Protection Regulation.<br>
### Roadmap
This is a demo project where everything is implemented directly in the project.<br/>
Very next on the TODO list is to convert the Loggable::Activity into a gem.<br/>
At the moment, it uses UUIDs as IDs on records and Postgres as the DB; this should be abstracted away.<br/>
There is a need for a sponsor to provide a host for showcasing the project in the wild.<br>

### What LoggableActivity does
Given there is a web app with a backend with various features and personas with different roles and permissions, <br/>
Then there might also be a need to log, showing who did what when.<br/>
For example:
- A doctor is looking at a patients journal, it might be confidential.
- A user is sending a personal message to another user, the user might be spamming, phishing etc...
- An administrator is granting an other user some permissions.

### Who is it for?
The logging system is intended for those who are in charge of monitoring how users interact with the system.<br/>
For example:
- Users with responsibility for security and traceability at a hospital.
- Supporters who needs a log of what a customer did when.
- System administrators who needs to know who updated an other users permissions.

### What it is not
- An error logging system
- A paper trails system with rollback.

### What is a log entity?
A log entry is a corelation between a timestamp, an actor and some records that belongs to one or more data owner 

### Basic features
- Create a log entry when an actor (that would mostly be current_user) performs an action.
- Categorize log entries based on actions
- Store a copy of relevant data involved
- Make log entries unavailable on the data owners request
- Download the log in a portable format for a given actor in a portable format.
- Anonymize the log for science projects if permission is granted by the data owner.
- Configure logging from a config.yaml file
